BASICS
git add FILENAME - stages changed files for a commit
git commit -m 'comment' - adds chnages to local repo
git push lightfoot master - e.g. pushes these changes to a remote, in this case lightfoot repo on github into the master

git status - tells me what is what
git remote - tells me what remotes I have open

use a .gitignore for files not to be tracked - e.g. *.[ca]  ignore all files ending in .c or .a

<<<<<<< HEAD
for pushing to git hub: git push origin master

for pushing to heroku: git push lightfoot master

to ignore files use the .gitignore file in root of project

to remove files from index git rm --cached *.c9save

=======
use git reset --hard origin/master if the branch and origin/master have diverged, i.e. I have a local change but the remote master was since updated, BUT i don't care about my local changes.
